        level: 2
        content: |-
         When trash usage is enabled in {{ app.friendly_name }} settings, deleted files are
         moved to the trash directory located at `/config/xdg/data/Trash` inside the
         container.

         > [!NOTE]
         > Using the trash may be slower than permanent deletion, especially for large
         > files, because the operation involves copying the file to the trash directory
         > before removing the original.
